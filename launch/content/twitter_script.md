# CogniCore/NEXUS — Twitter/X Video Script (60 seconds)

> **Format:** Screen recording + voiceover. Fast cuts. No filler.
> **Aspect ratio:** 1:1 or 9:16 (vertical for mobile)
> **Tone:** Fireship-speed. Every sentence earns its place.

## 0:00–0:03 — Hook

[SCREEN]: Close-up of terminal. Agent output scrolling — same error repeating.

[NARRATION]:
"Your AI agent just made the same mistake for the forty-seventh time."

[EMPHASIS]: Freeze frame. Red highlight on the repeated error.

---

## 0:03–0:15 — Problem

[SCREEN]: Fast montage — three different agent runs, all starting from zero. Token counter climbing. Same failure each time.

[NARRATION]:
"Every agent framework treats every run as stateless. No memory. No reflection. No learning from the last attempt. You're paying for the same failed tokens over and over."

[SCREEN]: Token cost number flashing: `$0.008 → $0.016 → $0.024 → ...`

[PAUSE]: 0.3 seconds.

---

## 0:15–0:35 — Solution

[SCREEN]: Terminal. Clean. Fast.

[NARRATION]:
"One pip install changes that."

[SCREEN]: Type:

```bash
pip install cognicore-env
python demo.py
```

[SCREEN]: Demo output scrolls — show the key result lines:

```
Baseline avg:   38.0%
CogniCore avg:  95.0%
Improvement:    +57.0%
```

[NARRATION]:
"38% to 95%. Same model. Same prompt. CogniCore adds persistent memory and a reflection engine to your agent's runtime. It remembers what worked. It remembers what failed. It gets better every episode."

[EMPHASIS]: The numbers `38% → 95%` grow large on screen. Hold for 1.5 seconds.

[NARRATION]:
"60+ environments. Works with OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Ollama. Gymnasium interface — nothing new to learn."

## 0:35–0:50 — The Counterintuitive Finding

[SCREEN]: The ablation results table appears:

```
Policy          Solved   Tokens
test_first      19/20    32,854  ✓
minimal         19/20    27,476  ✓
standard        18/20    37,118  ✗ (has reviewer)
review_first    18/20    45,591  ✗ (has reviewer)
```

[NARRATION]:
"Here's the part nobody talks about. We ran a full ablation — four routing policies, twenty tasks, two hundred eighty trajectories. Adding a code reviewer agent *reduces* solve rate by 5% and *increases* token cost by 35%."

[PAUSE]: 0.5 seconds.

[NARRATION]:
"More agents is not the answer. Smarter runtime is."

[EMPHASIS]: Text on screen — **"The model stays the same. The runtime gets smarter."**

---

## 0:50–0:60 — CTA

[SCREEN]: Clean slide. GitHub link. Star button.

[NARRATION]:
"Open source. MIT license. Benchmarks are reproducible — run them yourself. Link in the thread."

[SCREEN]:

```
pip install cognicore-env
github.com/Kaushalt2004/cognicore-my-openenv
```

[NARRATION]:
"Star it if you're tired of stateless agents."

[SCREEN]: Fade to black. Tagline holds: **"The model stays the same. The runtime gets smarter."**

## Production Notes

- **Total runtime:** 57–60 seconds. Hard cap. Cut anything over.
- **Editing:** Jump cuts every 3–5 seconds. No transitions, just hard cuts.
- **Text overlays:** Use large, bold text for key numbers. Sans-serif. White on dark.
- **Audio:** Voiceover only, no music. Or subtle lo-fi at -20dB max.
- **Caption:** Burn in. 90%+ of Twitter video is watched on mute.
- **Post copy:** "Your agent doesn't need a bigger model. It needs a memory. 🧠 pip install cognicore-env | github.com/Kaushalt2004/cognicore-my-openenv"
