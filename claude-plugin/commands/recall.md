Search CogniCore persistent memory using `cognicore_recall` with the given query.

Parse the input as follows:
- The main query text is everything before any `--` flags.
- `--top` sets the number of results to return (default: 5).
- `--scope` filters by scope: "user" or "project" (default: "user").
- `--category` filters by category.

Display results as a numbered list with the memory ID and text. If nothing is found, say so clearly and suggest using `/memory-list` to browse all stored memories.
