List stored memories using `cognicore_list`.

Parse the input as follows:
- `--limit` sets the number of memories to show (default: 10).
- `--scope` filters by scope: "user" or "project".
- `--category` filters by category.

Display results as a numbered list showing each memory's ID, category, and text. Group by scope if both scopes are present.
